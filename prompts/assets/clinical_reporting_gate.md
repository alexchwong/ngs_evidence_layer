# Clinical reporting gate

A clinically useful fact is one that could materially contribute to a concise myeloid NGS report by informing:

- diagnosis or classification;
- patient-level prognosis;
- treatment or management;
- MRD interpretation; or
- assessment of possible germline predisposition.

The fact must apply to the stated disease, molecular finding and clinical context.

Background information is not clinically useful by itself, including prevalence, epidemiology, study methodology, molecular mechanism alone, or descriptive associations without a clinical implication.

A negative or null finding is useful only when its absence or lack of effect is clinically informative.

When several findings support the same clinical conclusion, prefer the clinical conclusion rather than its component statistics.

## Geneless treatment claims

Geneless treatment claims (`genes: []`) use a stricter gate. Retain only claims that establish the usual or default treatment strategy for the stated disease or a routine treatment-defining clinical population, such as suitability for intensive therapy.

The claim must identify a standard regimen, treatment backbone, or standard alternative treatment strategy. Clinical actionability alone is insufficient.

Do not retain geneless claims whose usefulness depends on MRD or treatment response, transplant timing or conditioning, surveillance, clinical-trial eligibility, testing or work-up recommendations, or other downstream management advice.

Do not reclassify an otherwise ineligible geneless claim as `treatment` merely to permit `genes: []`.
