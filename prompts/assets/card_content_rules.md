# Card content rules

- One card represents one independently useful, directly supported clinical assertion.
- `genes` contains only genes participating in that assertion.
- `genes: []` is permitted only for geneless `diagnosis` or `treatment` assertions.
- A geneless `diagnosis` card must state an independently useful diagnostic/classification criterion, requirement, exclusion, threshold, or distinction.
- A geneless `treatment` card must satisfy the stricter geneless-treatment gate: it must state what treatment the defined patient population would ordinarily receive, independent of a molecular treatment modifier.
- Standard disease-level treatment backbones and standard alternatives for broad clinical strata are in scope; for example, intensive AML induction for suitable patients or venetoclax-based lower-intensity therapy for patients unsuitable for intensive treatment.
- Clinical actionability alone is insufficient for a geneless `treatment` card.
- `diseases` records exact source-supported clinical applicability; derived ancestors are indexing terms only and do not broaden scope.
- Do not merge distinct assertions merely because they share a gene, disease, category, paragraph, table, or census claim.

## Category entailment

- `diagnosis`: the passage states a molecular, morphologic, clinical, quantitative, or other criterion that defines, supports, excludes, differentiates, or changes a diagnosis or classification.
- `prognosis`: the passage explicitly states an outcome, risk, survival, progression, relapse, or named prognostic-model effect.
- `treatment`: the passage explicitly supports treatment selection, eligibility, standard treatment, sensitivity, resistance, response, or a treatment-specific effect.
- `biomarker`: the passage explicitly assigns a testing, detection, monitoring, or discrimination role that remains independently useful rather than merely relabelling the same diagnostic assertion. The interpretation must name that independent function.
- `germline`: the passage explicitly concerns inherited, constitutional, or predisposition status, or germline evaluation. Preserve the source's certainty; a work-up recommendation does not establish constitutional status.
