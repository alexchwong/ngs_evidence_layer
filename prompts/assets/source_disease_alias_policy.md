A source-stated disease may ground a canonical card disease only when it is already
canonical or exactly matches a reviewed alias in the canonical source-alias file,
ignoring surrounding whitespace and letter case only.

Emit only the canonical target in `diseases`, but preserve the source's actual disease
or population wording in evidence and interpretation. Canonical disease granularity
is intentionally broader than molecular subtype granularity; for example, reviewed
molecular B-ALL subtype names resolve to `B-ALL` rather than becoming separate card
diseases. Do not use fuzzy matching, stemming, punctuation substitution, semantic
inference, or nearest-term mapping. A source term that is neither canonical nor a
configured alias remains outside the controlled vocabulary.

Keep vocabulary relationships distinct:
- `diseases` = exact clinical applicability written on cards;
- `parents` = taxonomic ancestry used to derive `disease_ancestors` for indexing;
- `case_major_categories` = broad pre-adjudication case-retrieval buckets derived at
  runtime from canonical card diseases; never write them into cards;
- `retrieval_related` = directional, category-specific curated cross-disease
  applicability used by retrieval; never substitute it for exact card `diseases`.
