## 0.1.0

Initial release of the corpus-grounded evidence layer for myeloid NGS interpretation.

- Publication selection - Identifies the next indexed publication and ingestion phase to process.
- Phased ingestion - Prepares and accepts bounded census, extraction, and independent audit handoffs.
- Evidence validation - Checks schemas, census completeness, source-verbatim quotes, and audit requirements.
- Extraction rework - Returns failed audits to a controlled Phase 2 correction round while preserving provenance.
- Corpus building - Incorporates accepted packages into deterministic provisional or audited corpus and index files.
- Evidence retrieval - Selects gene- and disease-matched cards and reports genes the corpus cannot assess.
- Evidence rendering - Produces a deterministic, citable Markdown evidence block within a token budget.
- Citation key generation - Builds stable publication identifiers and display citations from citation metadata.
- Vocabulary validation - Enforces the closed disease vocabulary and required umbrella relationships.
